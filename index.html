        <h2>Vodka : The Absolut Bottle</h2>
        <p>This campaign branding ad ran nonstop for 25 years and had over 1500 versions, making it one of the longest continuous brand advertising examples on this list. The print ad campaign example focused on the Absolut bottleâ€™s recognizability and artfulness.<br><br>

            Absolut showcased the human side of its brand and opened the door to a consumer-brand relationship by linking the vodka bottle shape to events like Christmas, locations like Oslo and Manhattan, and sporting events like the World Cup. Absolut is among the best ad campaigns examples, which had increased its US sales from a modest 10,000 cases in 1980 to 4.5 million cases by the time the campaign ended in the mid-2000s.</p>
